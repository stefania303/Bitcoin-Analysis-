# Bitcoin-Analysis
This project analyzes historical Bitcoin price data using time series techniques. It visualizes open, high, low, and close prices with line and candlestick charts, compares linear vs. log scales, and studies daily price changes to highlight volatility and trends. The goal is to better understand how Bitcoin’s price behaves over time, rather than to build a trading strategy.
